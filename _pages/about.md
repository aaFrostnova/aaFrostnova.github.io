Hello👋! I am Mingzhe Li(李明哲), a first-year Ph.D student at [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu), advised by Prof. [Shiqing Ma](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shiqingma/).

I received my B.Eng in Cyberspace Security from [Wuhan University](https://cse.whu.edu.cn) in 2025. Before my time at WHU, I completed three years of study at the No.1 Middle School Affiliated to Central China Normal University [（华中师大一附中）](https://www.hzsdyfz.com.cn). 

My research focuses on **artificial intelligence security and privacy, Responsible Generative AI**.
